# cmd-calculator
Command line calculator where a string expression is passed in as an argument and is solved.

Command Line calculator was created for me to learn the [Go](https://go.dev) programming language.  
Used the [A Tour of Go](https://go.dev/tour/list) to learn the syntax of Go.  
Used the [Standard Library](https://pkg.go.dev/std@go1.18.3) to read about Go's standard packages.  
Last, [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) was used to clarify and confustion / questions I might have had while reviewing & reading `A Tour of Go` and the `Standard Library`
  
To run, simply type `cmdcalc "<expression>"` for example `cmdcalc "(2+2)*6"` and out come will be `(2+2)*6 = 24`
